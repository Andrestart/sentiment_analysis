THREEPIO,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!,episode4
THREEPIO,We're doomed!,episode4
THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.,episode4
THREEPIO,What's that?,episode4
THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...,episode4
LUKE,Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!,episode4
THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?",episode4
THREEPIO,At last!  Where have you been?,episode4
THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!,episode4
THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?",episode4
IMPERIAL OFFICER,The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.,episode4
VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?,episode4
REBEL OFFICER,We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.,episode4
VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?,episode4
VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!",episode4
TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!,episode4
TROOPER,She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.,episode4
THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..",episode4
THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you.",episode4
THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!,episode4
THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.,episode4
CHIEF PILOT,There goes another one.,episode4
CAPTAIN,Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.,episode4
THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.",episode4
THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?,episode4
WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down!,episode4
FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?,episode4
CAMIE,It was just Wormie on another rampage.,episode4
LUKE,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?,episode4
LUKE,I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?,episode4
BIGGS,"Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. ",episode4
LUKE,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?",episode4
BIGGS,Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.,episode4
LUKE,I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!,episode4
DEAK,Not again!  Forget it.,episode4
LUKE,There they are!,episode4
BIGGS,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.",episode4
LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...,episode4
LUKE,"Hey, easy with those...",episode4
CAMIE,"Don't worry about it, Wormie.",episode4
FIXER,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...",episode4
LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...",episode4
VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",episode4
LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...,episode4
VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!,episode4
COMMANDER,"Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.",episode4
VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!,episode4
COMMANDER,you anything.,episode4
VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!,episode4
SECOND OFFICER,"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",episode4
VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.",episode4
COMMANDER,"Yes, sir.",episode4
THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.,episode4
THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ,episode4
THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.,episode4
THREEPIO,Where are you going?,episode4
THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",episode4
THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?,episode4
THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.,episode4
THREEPIO,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!",episode4
THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.",episode4
THREEPIO,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.,episode4
THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!",episode4
THREEPIO,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!",episode4
LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",episode4
BIGGS,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",episode4
LUKE,Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...,episode4
BIGGS,I've missed you kid.,episode4
LUKE,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",episode4
BIGGS,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.",episode4
LUKE,What are you talking about?,episode4
BIGGS,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",episode4
LUKE,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?,episode4
BIGGS,Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!,episode4
LUKE,I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...,episode4
BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.,episode4
LUKE,around forever trying to find them.,episode4
BIGGS,"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",episode4
LUKE,And I'm stuck here...,episode4
BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.,episode4
LUKE,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.,episode4
BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.,episode4
LUKE,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.",episode4
BIGGS,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",episode4
LUKE,It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.,episode4
BIGGS,Things always change.,episode4
LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ,episode4
BIGGS,"No, I'm leaving in the morning...",episode4
LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.,episode4
BIGGS,Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.,episode4
LUKE,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.",episode4
BIGGS,"So long, Luke.",episode4
THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!,episode4
FIRST TROOPER,Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. ,episode4
SECOND TROOPER,"Look, sir - droids.",episode4
THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!,episode4
THREEPIO,We're doomed.,episode4
THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?,episode4
THREEPIO,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?,episode4
BERU,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",episode4
LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.,episode4
OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.,episode4
THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...,episode4
OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.,episode4
THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...,episode4
OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?,episode4
THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",episode4
OWEN,All right; shut up! I'll take this one.,episode4
THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir.",episode4
OWEN,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.",episode4
LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...,episode4
OWEN,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!",episode4
LUKE,"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.",episode4
LUKE,Uncle Owen...,episode4
OWEN,Yeah?,episode4
LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!,episode4
OWEN,"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?",episode4
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",episode4
LUKE,Uncle Owen...,episode4
OWEN,Yeah?,episode4
LUKE,What about that one?,episode4
OWEN,What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.,episode4
LUKE,"Yeah, take it away.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.",episode4
LUKE,"Okay, let's go.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!",episode4
THREEPIO,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!",episode4
LUKE,"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",episode4
THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help? ,episode4
LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!",episode4
THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.",episode4
LUKE,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.",episode4
THREEPIO,"I see, sir.",episode4
LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke.",episode4
THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke.",episode4
LUKE,Just Luke.,episode4
THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",episode4
LUKE,Hello.,episode4
LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.,episode4
THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",episode4
LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?,episode4
THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",episode4
LUKE,Have you been in many battles?,episode4
THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",episode4
LUKE,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",episode4
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.",episode4
LUKE,What's this?,episode4
THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?,episode4
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",episode4
LUKE,Who is she?  She's beautiful.,episode4
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",episode4
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...",episode4
THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",episode4
LUKE,Is there more to this recording?,episode4
THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.",episode4
THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",episode4
LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?,episode4
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?",episode4
LUKE,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",episode4
LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.,episode4
THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",episode4
LUKE,"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",episode4
LUKE,There you go.,episode4
LUKE,"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",episode4
THREEPIO,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! ,episode4
AUNT BERU,Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!,episode4
LUKE,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",episode4
THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",episode4
LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.",episode4
THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.,episode4
THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all.",episode4
THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either.",episode4
LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",episode4
OWEN,What makes you think that?,episode4
LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",episode4
LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.",episode4
OWEN,That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.,episode4
LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?,episode4
OWEN,"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",episode4
LUKE,He knew my father?,episode4
OWEN,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.,episode4
LUKE,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",episode4
OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest?,episode4
LUKE,"Sure, there're more than enough droids.",episode4
OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.,episode4
OWEN,"You must understand I need you here, Luke.",episode4
LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.,episode4
OWEN,"Look, it's only one more season.",episode4
LUKE,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",episode4
AUNT BERU,Where are you going?,episode4
LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.,episode4
AUNT BERU,"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",episode4
OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.,episode4
AUNT BERU,"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",episode4
OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of.,episode4
LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?,episode4
THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.",episode4
LUKE,"Oh, no!",episode4
THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. ,episode4
LUKE,How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!,episode4
THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",episode4
LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.,episode4
OWEN,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.",episode4
LUKE,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.",episode4
LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.,episode4
THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir.",episode4
OWEN,Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!,episode4
OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?,episode4
AUNT BERU,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",episode4
OWEN,Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?,episode4
AUNT BERU,I think so.,episode4
OWEN,"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",episode4
LUKE,How's that.,episode4
LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",episode4
LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...,episode4
THREEPIO,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...",episode4
LUKE,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.",episode4
LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?",episode4
THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",episode4
LUKE,"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.",episode4
THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.",episode4
LUKE,"No, he's not going to try anything.",episode4
LUKE,What's wrong with him now?,episode4
THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",episode4
LUKE,"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.",episode4
LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",episode4
BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.,episode4
BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right.",episode4
LUKE,What happened?,episode4
BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.",episode4
LUKE,"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! ",episode4
BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?",episode4
LUKE,"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?",episode4
BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.,episode4
LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.,episode4
BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",episode4
LUKE,You know him!,episode4
BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",episode4
LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.,episode4
BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... ,episode4
BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.,episode4
LUKE,... Threepio!,episode4
THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...,episode4
LUKE,Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.,episode4
THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.",episode4
LUKE,"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",episode4
BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move.",episode4
LUKE,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.",episode4
BEN,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.,episode4
LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?,episode4
BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",episode4
LUKE,I wish I'd known him.,episode4
BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...",episode4
BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",episode4
THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",episode4
LUKE,"Sure, go ahead.",episode4
LUKE,What is it?,episode4
BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.,episode4
BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",episode4
LUKE,How did my father die?,episode4
BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",episode4
LUKE,The Force?,episode4
BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",episode4
BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.",episode4
LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...,episode4
BEN,I seem to have found it.,episode4
LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",episode4
BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.,episode4
LUKE,"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",episode4
BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",episode4
LUKE,I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.,episode4
BEN,That's your uncle talking.,episode4
LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?",episode4
BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke.",episode4
LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",episode4
BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course.",episode4
TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.,episode4
MOTTI,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",episode4
TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....,episode4
TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,episode4
TAGGE,That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?,episode4
TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.,episode4
TAGGE,"And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",episode4
VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,episode4
MOTTI,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",episode4
VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,episode4
MOTTI,"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",episode4
VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,episode4
TARKIN,"Enough of this!  Vader, release him!",episode4
VADER,As you wish.,episode4
TARKIN,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.,episode4
LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",episode4
BEN,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.,episode4
LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.,episode4
BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",episode4
LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?,episode4
LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!",episode4
BEN,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.",episode4
LUKE,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!,episode4
VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",episode4
BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.",episode4
LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.,episode4
BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.,episode4
TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?,episode4
LUKE,About three or four seasons.,episode4
BEN,They're for sale if you want them.,episode4
TROOPER,Let me see your identification.,episode4
BEN,You don't need to see his identification.,episode4
TROOPER,We don't need to see his identification.,episode4
BEN,looking for.,episode4
TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking for.,episode4
BEN,He can go about his business.,episode4
TROOPER,You can go about your business.,episode4
BEN,Move along.,episode4
TROOPER,Move along.  Move along.,episode4
THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.,episode4
LUKE,"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",episode4
BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.,episode4
LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?,episode4
BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",episode4
LUKE,I'm ready for anything.,episode4
THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo.",episode4
BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here!,episode4
LUKE,What?,episode4
BARTENDER,Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.,episode4
LUKE,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.",episode4
THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.,episode4
CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?,episode4
HUMAN,He doesn't like you.,episode4
LUKE,I'm sorry.,episode4
HUMAN,I don't like you either,episode4
HUMAN,Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.,episode4
LUKE,I'll be careful than.,episode4
HUMAN,You'll be dead.,episode4
BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...,episode4
BARTENDER,No blasters!  No blaster!,episode4
BEN,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.,episode4
THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.,episode4
HAN,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.,episode4
BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",episode4
HAN,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?,episode4
BEN,Should I have?,episode4
HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!,episode4
HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?",episode4
BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.",episode4
HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?,episode4
BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.,episode4
HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",episode4
LUKE,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!,episode4
HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?",episode4
LUKE,You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...,episode4
BEN,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",episode4
HAN,"Seventeen, huh!",episode4
HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.,episode4
BEN,Ninety-four.,episode4
HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.,episode4
TROOPER,"All right, we'll check it out.",episode4
HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.,episode4
BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.,episode4
LUKE,That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.,episode4
GREEDO,"Going somewhere, Solo?",episode4
HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",episode4
GREEDO,"It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.",episode4
HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money.",episode4
GREEDO,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.",episode4
HAN,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...,episode4
GREEDO,Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.,episode4
HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?,episode4
GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.,episode4
HAN,Over my dead body.,episode4
GREEDO,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.,episode4
HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have.",episode4
HAN,Sorry about the mess.,episode4
VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.,episode4
IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?,episode4
TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.,episode4
VADER,What do you mean?,episode4
TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.,episode4
TROOPER,With pleasure.,episode4
THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo.",episode4
TROOPER,"All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.",episode4
THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.",episode4
THREEPIO,You watch your language!,episode4
LUKE,"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they ",episode4
BEN,It will be enough.,episode4
BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",episode4
JABBA,"Come on out, Solo!",episode4
HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba.",episode4
JABBA,I expected you would be.,episode4
HAN,I'm not the type to run.,episode4
JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",episode4
HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.,episode4
JABBA,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.",episode4
HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",episode4
JABBA,"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",episode4
HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",episode4
JABBA,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",episode4
HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",episode4
LUKE,What a piece of junk.,episode4
HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself.",episode4
HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir.",episode4
TROOPER,Which way?,episode4
TROOPER,"All right, men.  Load your weapons!",episode4
TROOPER,Stop that ship!,episode4
TROOPER,Blast 'em!,episode4
HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!",episode4
THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.",episode4
HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.,episode4
HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.,episode4
LUKE,Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.,episode4
HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",episode4
HAN,Here's where the fun begins!,episode4
BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?,episode4
HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.,episode4
LUKE,Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...,episode4
HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",episode4
LUKE,What's that flashing?,episode4
HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.",episode4
MOTTI,We've entered the Alderaan system.,episode4
LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",episode4
TARKIN,Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!,episode4
LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!,episode4
TARKIN,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",episode4
LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",episode4
TARKIN,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",episode4
LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...,episode4
TARKIN,You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!,episode4
TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?,episode4
LEIA,Dantooine.,episode4
LEIA,They're on Dantooine.,episode4
TARKIN,"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",episode4
LEIA,What?,episode4
TARKIN,You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ,episode4
LEIA,No!,episode4
VADER,Commence primary ignition.,episode4
LUKE,Are you all right?  What's wrong?,episode4
BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.,episode4
BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.,episode4
HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",episode4
HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.,episode4
HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo.",episode4
THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.,episode4
HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.,episode4
THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",episode4
HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.,episode4
THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",episode4
BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",episode4
LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?,episode4
BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.,episode4
HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",episode4
LUKE,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?",episode4
HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",episode4
HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.,episode4
BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke.",episode4
BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",episode4
LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?",episode4
BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.,episode4
BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.,episode4
BEN,"You see, you can do it.",episode4
HAN,I call it luck. ,episode4
BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.",episode4
HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",episode4
HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.,episode4
LUKE,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",episode4
BEN,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.,episode4
TARKIN,Yes.,episode4
OFFICER CASS,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",episode4
TARKIN,She lied!  She lied to us!,episode4
VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.,episode4
TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!,episode4
HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",episode4
HAN,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.",episode4
LUKE,What's going on?,episode4
HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!",episode4
LUKE,What do you mean?  Where is it?,episode4
HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",episode4
LUKE,What?  How?,episode4
BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!,episode4
HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...,episode4
HAN,There's another ship coming in.,episode4
LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.,episode4
BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.,episode4
LUKE,It followed us!,episode4
BEN,No.  It's a short range fighter.,episode4
HAN,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?,episode4
LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",episode4
HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.,episode4
BEN,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.,episode4
HAN,Not for long...,episode4
BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.,episode4
LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",episode4
HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",episode4
LUKE,Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.,episode4
HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.,episode4
BEN,That's no moon!  It's a space station.,episode4
HAN,It's too big to be a space station.,episode4
LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.,episode4
BEN,Turn the ship around!,episode4
HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",episode4
LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?,episode4
HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!,episode4
LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do!,episode4
HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!",episode4
BEN,You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.,episode4
VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM,Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.,episode4
OFFICER,To your stations!,episode4
OFFICER,Come with me.,episode4
OFFICER,Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!,episode4
TARKIN,Yes.,episode4
VOICE,We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.,episode4
VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.,episode4
VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.,episode4
OFFICER,"There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",episode4
VADER,Did you find any droids?,episode4
OFFICER,"No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.",episode4
VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.,episode4
OFFICER,"Yes, sir.",episode4
VADER,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...,episode4
OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!,episode4
LUKE,"Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.",episode4
HAN,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.",episode4
BEN,Leave that to me!,episode4
HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!,episode4
BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?,episode4
TROOPER,"The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.",episode4
HAN,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?",episode4
GANTRY OFFICER,"TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? ",episode4
GANTRY OFFICER,Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.,episode4
LUKE,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.",episode4
HAN,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.,episode4
THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir.",episode4
BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.,episode4
THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.,episode4
THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.,episode4
BEN,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.,episode4
HAN,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.,episode4
LUKE,I want to go with you.,episode4
BEN,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.",episode4
LUKE,But he can...,episode4
BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!,episode4
HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie.",episode4
HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?,episode4
LUKE,Ben is a great man.,episode4
HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",episode4
LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas...,episode4
HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",episode4
LUKE,Who do you think...,episode4
LUKE,What is it?,episode4
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \",episode4
LUKE,"Well, who... who has he found?",episode4
THREEPIO,Princess Leia.,episode4
LUKE,The princess?  She's here?,episode4
HAN,Princess?,episode4
LUKE,Where... where is she?,episode4
HAN,Princess?  What's going on?,episode4
THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.,episode4
LUKE,"Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",episode4
HAN,What are you talking about?,episode4
LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.,episode4
HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",episode4
LUKE,"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?",episode4
HAN,I'm not going anywhere.,episode4
LUKE,"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",episode4
HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.,episode4
LUKE,But they're going to kill her!,episode4
HAN,Better her than me...,episode4
LUKE,She's rich.,episode4
HAN,Rich?,episode4
LUKE,"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...",episode4
HAN,What?,episode4
LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.,episode4
HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!",episode4
LUKE,You'll get it!,episode4
HAN,I better!,episode4
LUKE,You will...,episode4
HAN,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",episode4
LUKE,All right.,episode4
HAN,What's your plan?,episode4
LUKE,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?",episode4
LUKE,"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.",episode4
LUKE,"Okay.  Han, you put these on.",episode4
HAN,"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",episode4
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?",episode4
LUKE,Lock the door!,episode4
HAN,And hope they don't have blasters.,episode4
THREEPIO,That isn't very reassuring.,episode4
LUKE,I can't see a thing in this helmet.,episode4
HAN,This is not going to work.,episode4
LUKE,Why didn't you say so before?,episode4
HAN,I did say so before!,episode4
OFFICER,Where are you taking this... thing?,episode4
LUKE,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.,episode4
OFFICER,I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.,episode4
HAN,Look out!  He's loose!,episode4
LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart.,episode4
HAN,Go get him!,episode4
HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.,episode4
HAN,Everything is under control.  Situation normal.,episode4
INTERCOM VOICE,What happened?,episode4
HAN,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",episode4
INTERCOM VOICE,We're sending a squad up.,episode4
HAN,"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.",episode4
INTERCOM VOICE,Who is this?  What's your operating number?,episode4
HAN,Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!,episode4
LEIA,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?,episode4
LUKE,What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. ,episode4
LEIA,You're who?,episode4
LUKE,I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.,episode4
LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?,episode4
LUKE,Come on!,episode4
VADER,He is here...,episode4
TARKIN,Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?,episode4
VADER,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.,episode4
TARKIN,Surely he must be dead by now.,episode4
VADER,Don't underestimate the Force.,episode4
TARKIN,"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",episode4
TARKIN,Yes.,episode4
INTERCOM VOICE,"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.",episode4
TARKIN,The princess!  Put all sections on alert!,episode4
VADER,Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.,episode4
TARKIN,"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",episode4
VADER,Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.,episode4
HAN,Chewie!,episode4
HAN,Get behind me!  Get behind me!,episode4
HAN,Can't get out that way.,episode4
LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.,episode4
HAN,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.",episode4
LUKE,See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!,episode4
THREEPIO,Yes sir?,episode4
LUKE,We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!,episode4
THREEPIO,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.",episode4

LEIA,Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.,episode4

LEIA,We did it!,episode4
THREEPIO,Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.,episode4
TARKIN,Are they away?,episode4
VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.,episode4
TARKIN,"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",episode4
HAN,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.",episode4
LEIA,"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",episode4
HAN,Easy... you call that easy?,episode4
LEIA,Their tracking us!,episode4
HAN,"Not this ship, sister.",episode4
LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.,episode4
HAN,What's so important?  What's he carrying?,episode4
LEIA,"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",episode4
HAN,"It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!",episode4
LEIA,"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",episode4
LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.,episode4
LUKE,I care!,episode4
LUKE,"So... what do you think of her, Han?",episode4

LUKE,No!,episode4
WILLARD,You're safe!  We had feared the worst.,episode4
WILLARD,"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.",episode4
LEIA,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",episode4
TARKIN,Yes.,episode4
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.,episode4
DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.,episode4
GOLD LEADER,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?",episode4
DODONNA,"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",episode4
DODONNA,"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",episode4
DODONNA,"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",episode4
WEDGE,"That's impossible, even for a computer.",episode4
LUKE,It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.,episode4
DODONNA,Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!,episode4
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.,episode4
VADER,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.,episode4
MAN,"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",episode4
LUKE,So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?,episode4
HAN,"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.",episode4
LUKE,"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.",episode4
HAN,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",episode4
LUKE,"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",episode4
HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!",episode4
HAN,What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.,episode4
LEIA,What's wrong?,episode4
LUKE,"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. ",episode4
LEIA,He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.,episode4
LUKE,I only wish Ben were here.,episode4
BIGGS,Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!,episode4

RED LEADER,Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?,episode4
BIGGS,"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.",episode4
RED LEADER,"I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.",episode4
LUKE,"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.",episode4
BIGGS,"I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?",episode4
LUKE,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.",episode4
BIGGS,"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!",episode4
CHIEF,This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?,episode4
LUKE,"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?",episode4

HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!,episode5
THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off.",episode5
HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir.",episode5
HAN,Put them back together right now.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?",episode5
HAN,What do you want?,episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you  on the communicator.",episode5
HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He  hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.",episode5
HAN,I don't know where he is.,episode5
THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.,episode5
HAN,"What do you mean, \",episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see...",episode5
HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...",episode5
DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir?",episode5
HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?,episode5
DECK OFFICER,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the  south entrance.,episode5
HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.,episode5
DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?",episode5
HAN,Why not?,episode5
THREEPIO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.",episode5
DECK OFFICER,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the  south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.",episode5
HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?,episode5
DECK OFFICER,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the  cold.,episode5
HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.,episode5
DECK OFFICER,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.",episode5
HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.,episode5
ASSISTANT OFFICER,I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set  screen alpha.,episode5
DECK OFFICER,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first  marker.,episode5
HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!,episode5
THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more  we can do. And my joints are freezing up.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.",episode5
LIEUTENANT,"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from  Skywalker or Solo.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up  any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.",episode5
DERLIN,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed.",episode5
DERLIN,Close the doors.,episode5
LIEUTENANT,"Yes, sir.",episode5
THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.",episode5
BEN,Luke...Luke.,episode5
LUKE,Ben?,episode5
BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.,episode5
LUKE,Dagobah system?,episode5
BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed  me.",episode5
LUKE,Ben...Ben.,episode5
HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.",episode5
HAN,Not much time.,episode5
LUKE,Ben...Ben...,episode5
HAN,"Hang on, kid.",episode5
LUKE,Dagobah system...,episode5
HAN,Whew...,episode5
LUKE,Dagobah...,episode5
HAN,"This may smell bad, kid...",episode5
LUKE,Yoda...,episode5
HAN,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!,episode5
ZEV,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but  it could be a life form.",episode5
ZEV,"This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two.",episode5
HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.,episode5
ZEV,"Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found  them. Repeat, I found them.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional  again.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also.",episode5
HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.",episode5
LUKE,Thanks to you.,episode5
HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior.",episode5
HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer.",episode5
LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.,episode5
HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,episode5
LEIA,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.",episode5
HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage.",episode5
HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.,episode5
LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!",episode5
HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?",episode5
LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?",episode5
ANNOUNCER,"Headquarters personnel, report to command  center.",episode5
HAN,Take it easy.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please.",episode5
RIEEKAN,Princess...we have a visitor.,episode5
RIEEKAN,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve,  moving east.",episode5
SENIOR CONTROLLER,It's metal.,episode5
LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.,episode5
HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours.",episode5
SENIOR CONTROLLER,No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.",episode5
HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out.",episode5
RIEEKAN,Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.,episode5
HAN,Afraid there's not much left.,episode5
LEIA,What was it?,episode5
HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.,episode5
LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.,episode5
HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.,episode5
RIEEKAN,We'd better start the evacuation.,episode5
PIETT,Admiral.,episode5
OZZEL,"Yes, Captain",episode5
PIETT,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment  had.",episode5
OZZEL,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the  galaxy. I want proof, not leads!",episode5
PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.,episode5
OZZEL,It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...,episode5
PIETT,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human  forms.",episode5
VADER,You found something?,episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
VADER,That's it. The  Rebels are there.,episode5
OZZEL,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be  smugglers, it could be...",episode5
VADER,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.",episode5
REBEL CAPTAIN,"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.",episode5
REBEL FIGHTER,"Right, sir.",episode5
HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!",episode5
MEDICAL DROID,"Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-  sevens.",episode5
LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get  the smaller modules on the transports.",episode5
MEDICAL DROID,"Take care, sir.",episode5
LUKE,Thanks.,episode5
LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?",episode5
HAN,"Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?",episode5
LUKE,Yeah.,episode5
HAN,Be careful.,episode5
LUKE,"You, too.",episode5
CONTROLLER,"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of  hyperspace in sector four.",episode5
RIEEKAN,Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.,episode5
VADER,"What is it, General?",episode5
VEERS,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has  detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.",episode5
VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.,episode5
VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...,episode5
VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops  for a surface attack.",episode5
VEERS,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
OZZEL,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're  preparing to...Aaagh!",episode5
VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.",episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.",episode5
PIETT,"Thank you, Lord Vader.",episode5
LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.",episode5
HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?,episode5
LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?",episode5
PILOTS,Right. Okay.,episode5
LEIA,Good luck.,episode5
DERLIN,Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!,episode5
RIEEKAN,Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to  open the shield.,episode5
CONTROLLER,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.",episode5
CAPTAIN,Good. Our first catch of the day.,episode5
WOMAN CONTROLLER,"Stand by, ion control....Fire!",episode5
ANNOUNCER,The first transport is away.,episode5
DACK,"Feeling all right, sir?",episode5
LUKE,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?",episode5
DACK,Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.,episode5
LUKE,I know what you mean.,episode5
TRENCH OFFICER,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.,episode5
TRENCH OFFICER,We have spotted Imperial walkers!,episode5
CONTROLLER,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.,episode5
LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.,episode5
LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now.",episode5
DACK,"Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.",episode5
LUKE,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!",episode5
LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in.",episode5
LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?",episode5
LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.,episode5
LUKE,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go  for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them.  All right, stand by, Dack.",episode5
DACK,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut  in the auxiliary.",episode5
LUKE,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.",episode5
LUKE,Dack? Dack!,episode5
VEERS,"Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The  shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.",episode5
LUKE,Rouge Three.,episode5
WEDGE,"Copy, Rouge Leader",episode5
LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make  this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.",episode5
WEDGE,"Coming around, Rouge Leader.",episode5
LUKE,"Steady, Rouge Two",episode5
WEDGE,Activate harpoon.,episode5
WEDGE,"Good shot, Janson.",episode5
WEDGE,One more pass.,episode5
JANSON,Coming around. Once more.,episode5
JANSON,One more.,episode5
JANSON,Cable out! Let her go!,episode5
WEDGE,Detach cable.,episode5
JANSON,Cable detached.,episode5
TRENCH OFFICER,Come on!,episode5
WEDGE,Whooha!! That got him!,episode5
LUKE,"I see it, Wedge. Good work.",episode5
RIEEKAN,I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.,episode5
LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no  choice.",episode5
RIEEKAN,Launch patrols.,episode5
LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.,episode5
HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?",episode5
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.",episode5
VEERS,All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target  the main generator.,episode5
LUKE,"Rouge Two, are you all right?",episode5
ZEV,"Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader.",episode5
LUKE,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.,episode5
ZEV,Coming around.,episode5
LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys.",episode5
ZEV,Set for position three.  Steady.,episode5
LUKE,Stay tight and low.,episode5
LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!",episode5
HAN,You all right?,episode5
LEIA,Why are you still here?,episode5
HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.,episode5
LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.,episode5
HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our  only hope.",episode5
LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.,episode5
ANNOUNCER,Imperial troops have entered the base.,episode5
HAN,Come on...that's it.,episode5
LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!,episode5
HEAD CONTROLLER,K-one-zero...all troops disengage.,episode5
THREEPIO,Oh! Wait for me!,episode5
OFFICER,Begin retreat!,episode5
SECOND OFFICER,Fall back!,episode5
VEERS,Distance to power generators?,episode5
PILOT,"One-seven, decimal two-eight.",episode5
VEERS,Target. Maximum fire power.,episode5
HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.",episode5
THREEPIO,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!,episode5
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!,episode5
THREEPIO,How typical.,episode5
HAN,Come on.,episode5
HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!",episode5
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait!,episode5
HAN,How's this?,episode5
LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?,episode5
HAN,It might.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that  you...",episode5
THREEPIO,It can wait.,episode5
LEIA,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.,episode5
HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.",episode5
HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.,episode5
HAN,See?,episode5
LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.",episode5
HAN,Punch it!,episode5
LUKE,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.,episode5
WEDGE,"Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.",episode5
LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.",episode5
LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a  new course.",episode5
LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.,episode5
LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.,episode5
LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?",episode5
LUKE,That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manual control for a while.,episode5
HAN,I saw them! I saw them!,episode5
LEIA,Saw what?,episode5
HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest...",episode5
HAN,Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!,episode5
HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.",episode5
IMPERIAL OFFICER,Take evasive action!,episode5
HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.,episode5
THREEPIO,"But, sir!",episode5
LEIA,They're getting closer!,episode5
HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.,episode5
LEIA,Watch what?,episode5
HAN,I think we're in trouble.,episode5
THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive  motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!",episode5
HAN,We're in trouble!,episode5
HAN,Horizontal boosters...!,episode5
HAN,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.,episode5
HAN,Bring me the hydrospanners!,episode5
HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.,episode5
HAN,Oww! Chewie!,episode5
HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.,episode5
LEIA,"Han, get up here!",episode5
HAN,"Come on, Chewie!",episode5
LEIA,Asteroids!,episode5
HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.",episode5
LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?,episode5
HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?",episode5
LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid  field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.",episode5
HAN,Never tell me the odds!,episode5
HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart.",episode5
LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.,episode5
HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.,episode5
THREEPIO,Pulverized?,episode5
HAN,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.,episode5
LEIA,Closer?,episode5
THREEPIO,Closer?!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!",episode5
HAN,There. That looks pretty good.,episode5
LEIA,What looks pretty good?,episode5
HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?",episode5
LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.,episode5
HAN,"Yeah, me too.",episode5
LUKE,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah.",episode5
LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.   I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there...",episode5
LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.",episode5
LUKE,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't  see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...",episode5
LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.",episode5
LUKE,Artoo?,episode5
LUKE,Artoo! Where are you?,episode5
LUKE,Artoo! You be more careful.,episode5
LUKE,Artoo -- that way!,episode5
LUKE,Artoo!,episode5
LUKE,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste  very good. Anything broken?",episode5
LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to  agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.",episode5
VADER,"Yes, Admiral?",episode5
PIETT,"Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it  has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...",episode5
VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses.",episode5
PIETT,"Yes, lord.",episode5
HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include  shutting me down, too?",episode5
HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable.",episode5
HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...",episode5
LEIA,Let go.,episode5
HAN,Sshh!,episode5
LEIA,"Let go, please.",episode5
HAN,Don't get excited.,episode5
LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.",episode5
HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.",episode5
LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.  There you go.,episode5
LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.,episode5
LUKE,Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I don't know...,episode5
STRANGE VOICE,Feel like what?,episode5
LUKE,Like we're being watched!,episode5
CREATURE,Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.,episode5
CREATURE,"I am wondering, why are you here?",episode5
LUKE,I'm looking for someone.,episode5
CREATURE,"Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?",episode5
LUKE,Right.,episode5
CREATURE,"Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.",episode5
LUKE,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.,episode5
CREATURE,Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not  make one great.,episode5
LUKE,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.,episode5
CREATURE,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?",episode5
LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we  could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...",episode5
CREATURE,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?",episode5
LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're  making a mess. Hey, give me that!",episode5
CREATURE,Mine! Or I will help you not.,episode5
LUKE,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get  out of this slimy mudhole.,episode5
CREATURE,Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.,episode5
CREATURE,"Ah, ah, ah!",episode5
LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it.",episode5
CREATURE,Mine! Mine!,episode5
LUKE,Artoo!,episode5
CREATURE,Mine!,episode5
CREATURE,Mine!,episode5
LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot  of work to do.",episode5
CREATURE,"No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your  friend, hmm?",episode5
LUKE,"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.",episode5
CREATURE,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.,episode5
LUKE,You know him?,episode5
CREATURE,"Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we  must eat. Come. Good food. Come.",episode5
CREATURE,"Come, come.",episode5
LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?",episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.",episode5
HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it.",episode5
HAN,Here! And Chewie...,episode5
HAN,...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.,episode5
HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.",episode5
LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?,episode5
HAN,"Sure, Leia.",episode5
LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.",episode5
HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.",episode5
LEIA,Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.,episode5
HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.,episode5
LEIA,Stop that.,episode5
HAN,Stop what?,episode5
LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.,episode5
HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?",episode5
LEIA,Afraid?,episode5
HAN,You're trembling.,episode5
LEIA,I'm not trembling.,episode5
HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.,episode5
LEIA,I happen to like nice men.,episode5
HAN,I'm a nice man.,episode5
LEIA,"No, you're not. You're...",episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.",episode5
HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.",episode5
NEEDA,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.",episode5
VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found.",episode5
PIETT,Lord Vader.,episode5
VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?",episode5
PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,episode5
VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.,episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?",episode5
EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,episode5
VADER,I have felt it.,episode5
EMPEROR,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.,episode5
VADER,"Yes, my master.",episode5
EMPEROR,He could destroy us.,episode5
VADER,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,episode5
EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.,episode5
VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.",episode5
EMPEROR,Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?,episode5
VADER,"He will join us or die, my master.",episode5
LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we  can't see Yoda now.",episode5
CREATURE,"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat.  Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?",episode5
LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?,episode5
CREATURE,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?",episode5
LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess.",episode5
CREATURE,"Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.",episode5
LUKE,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You  don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.",episode5
CREATURE,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.,episode5
BEN,He will learn patience.,episode5
YODA,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.",episode5
BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?,episode5
YODA,Hah. He is not ready.,episode5
LUKE,"Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm  ready.",episode5
YODA,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!",episode5
BEN,"So was I, if you'll remember.",episode5
YODA,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.",episode5
LUKE,But I've learned so much.,episode5
YODA,Will he finished what he begins?,episode5
LUKE,I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.,episode5
YODA,"Oh, you will be. You will be.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion...",episode5
HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.",episode5
LEIA,There's something out there.,episode5
HAN,Where?,episode5
LEIA,"Outside, in the cave.",episode5
THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!,episode5
HAN,I'm going out there.,episode5
LEIA,Are you crazy?!,episode5
HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.,episode5
LEIA,Then I'm going with you.,episode5
THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh, no.",episode5
LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.,episode5
HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.,episode5
LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.,episode5
HAN,Yeah.,episode5
HAN,Watch out!,episode5
HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.",episode5
LEIA,Mynocks?,episode5
HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.,episode5
THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!,episode5
HAN,Wait a minute...,episode5
HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!",episode5
LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...,episode5
HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.,episode5
LEIA,I am not a committee!,episode5
LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...,episode5
HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!",episode5
THREEPIO,Look!,episode5
HAN,"I see it, I see it.",episode5
THREEPIO,We're doomed!,episode5
LEIA,The cave is collapsing.,episode5
HAN,This is no cave.,episode5
LEIA,What?,episode5
YODA,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.",episode5
LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?,episode5
YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.",episode5
LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,episode5
YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",episode5
LUKE,But tell me why I can't...,episode5
YODA,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.",episode5
LUKE,There's something not right here.,episode5
LUKE,"I feel cold, death.",episode5
YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.,episode5
LUKE,What's in there?,episode5
YODA,Only what you take with you.,episode5
YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.,episode5
PIETT,Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.,episode5
FIRST CONTROLLER,"Yes, sir.",episode5
PIETT,Those Rebels won't escape us.,episode5
SECOND CONTROLLER,"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger.",episode5
PIETT,Right.,episode5
VADER,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.",episode5
BOBA FETT,As you wish.,episode5
PIETT,"Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.",episode5
HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!,episode5
HAN,It's not fair!,episode5
HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!,episode5
LEIA,No light-speed?,episode5
HAN,It's not my fault.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.",episode5
HAN,Turn her around.,episode5
HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.,episode5
LEIA,You're going to attack them?!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer...",episode5
LEIA,Shut up!,episode5
NEEDA,They're moving to attack position. Shields up!,episode5
NEEDA,"Track them,. They may come around for another pass.",episode5
TRACKING OFFICER,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our  scopes.",episode5
NEEDA,They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.,episode5
TRACKING OFFICER,"Well, there's no trace of them, sir.",episode5
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit.",episode5
NEEDA,"Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.",episode5
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Yes, Captain Needa.",episode5
YODA,Use the Force. Yes...,episode5
YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.,episode5
YODA,Concentrate!,episode5
LUKE,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.",episode5
YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?,episode5
LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different.",episode5
YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.,episode5
LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try.",episode5
YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.,episode5
LUKE,I can't. It's too big.,episode5
YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm.",episode5
YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!",episode5
LUKE,You want the impossible.,episode5
LUKE,I don't...I don't believe it.,episode5
YODA,That is why you fail.,episode5
VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa.",episode5
PIETT,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.",episode5
VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.,episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord. We'll find them.",episode5
VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral.",episode5
PIETT,Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?",episode5
HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.,episode5
THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,episode5
HAN,Thank you.,episode5
LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?,episode5
HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.",episode5
LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,episode5
HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?,episode5
LEIA,No. Where are we?,episode5
HAN,The Anoat system.,episode5
LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.,episode5
HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.",episode5
LEIA,Lando system?,episode5
HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.",episode5
LEIA,Thanks.,episode5
HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.",episode5
LEIA,A mining colony?,episode5
HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me.",episode5
LEIA,Can you trust him?,episode5
HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.",episode5
HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!",episode5
LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.",episode5
YODA,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.",episode5
LUKE,Han! Leia!,episode5
YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.",episode5
LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.,episode5
YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.,episode5
LUKE,They were in pain.,episode5
YODA,It is the future you see.,episode5
LUKE,Future? Will they die?,episode5
YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.,episode5
LUKE,I've got to go to them.,episode5
YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.",episode5
HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian.",episode5
HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.,episode5
INTERCOM VOICE,You will not deviate from your present course.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?",episode5
LEIA,I thought you knew this person.,episode5
HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that.",episode5
INTERCOM VOICE,Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.,episode5
HAN,Thank you.,episode5
HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.",episode5
LEIA,Who's worried?,episode5
THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.,episode5
LEIA,I don't like this.,episode5
HAN,"Well, what would you like?",episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land.",episode5
HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.",episode5
HAN,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?",episode5
LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.",episode5
LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?",episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly.",episode5
LEIA,Yes...very friendly.,episode5
LANDO,What are you doing here?,episode5
HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.,episode5
LANDO,What have you done to my ship?,episode5
HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.",episode5
LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?,episode5
LEIA,Leia.,episode5
LANDO,"Welcome, Leia.",episode5
HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie.",episode5
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your...",episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, really!",episode5
LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?,episode5
HAN,Hyperdrive.,episode5
LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.,episode5
HAN,Good.,episode5
LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.",episode5
HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?,episode5
LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?",episode5
HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?",episode5
LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.",episode5
HAN,Yeah.,episode5
LANDO,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful.",episode5
THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.,episode5
SECOND THREEPIO,E chu ta!,episode5
THREEPIO,How rude!,episode5
THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...,episode5
THREEPIO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.",episode5
MAN,Who are you?,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!",episode5
YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.,episode5
LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.,episode5
YODA,You must not go!,episode5
LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.,episode5
BEN,You don't know that.,episode5
BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.,episode5
LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!,episode5
BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.",episode5
YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!",episode5
LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.",episode5
BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.,episode5
LUKE,And that is why I have to go.,episode5
BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader.",episode5
LUKE,You won't.,episode5
YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.",episode5
BEN,Patience.,episode5
LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?,episode5
YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!,episode5
BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.",episode5
LUKE,"I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters.",episode5
BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.",episode5
YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.,episode5
LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.,episode5
YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.",episode5
BEN,That boy is our last hope.,episode5
YODA,No. There is another.,episode5
HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.,episode5
LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.,episode5
HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,episode5
LEIA,I don't trust Lando.,episode5
HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.",episode5
LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?",episode5
LEIA,What happened?,episode5
HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?,episode5
LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?",episode5
HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.,episode5
LEIA,"No, thanks.",episode5
LANDO,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?,episode5
LEIA,Not really.,episode5
LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.,episode5
LEIA,Thank you.,episode5
LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?,episode5
LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course.",episode5
LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?,episode5
HAN,No. No problem. Why?,episode5
LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.",episode5
LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?,episode5
LANDO,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.",episode5
HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?,episode5
LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,episode5
VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.,episode5
LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.,episode5
HAN,"I'm sorry, too.",episode5
LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them.",episode5
LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!",episode5
THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!",episode5
LANDO,Lord Vader.,episode5
VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.,episode5
BOBA FETT,He's no good to me dead.,episode5
VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.,episode5
LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?",episode5
VADER,They must never again leave this city.,episode5
LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!",episode5
VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.,episode5
LANDO,No.,episode5
VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.,episode5
LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...",episode5
HAN,I feel terrible.,episode5
LEIA,Why are they doing this?,episode5
HAN,They never even asked me any questions.,episode5
LEIA,Lando.,episode5
HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!",episode5
LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.,episode5
HAN,Over to you?,episode5
LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.",episode5
LEIA,What about Han?,episode5
LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.,episode5
LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.,episode5
LANDO,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.,episode5
HAN,Luke?,episode5
LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.,episode5
LEIA,And we're the bait.,episode5
LANDO,"Well, he's on his way.",episode5
HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!",episode5
LANDO,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems.",episode5
HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero.",episode5
LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.,episode5
VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.",episode5
IMPERIAL SOLDIER,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.",episode5
VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,episode5
LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him.",episode5
VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.,episode5
THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.",episode5
HAN,What's going on...buddy?,episode5
LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.,episode5
BOBA FETT,What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.,episode5
VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!",episode5
HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!",episode5
THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.",episode5
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!",episode5
HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?,episode5
LEIA,I love you!,episode5
HAN,I know.,episode5
THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.",episode5
VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?",episode5
LANDO,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.",episode5
VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,episode5
IMPERIAL OFFICER,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord.",episode5
VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.",episode5
LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.,episode5
VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.,episode5
LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!",episode5
VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.",episode5
LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.,episode5
LEIA,What do you think you're doing?,episode5
LANDO,We're getting out of here.,episode5
THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,episode5
LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?,episode5
LANDO,I had no choice...,episode5
THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!",episode5
LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.",episode5
LANDO,I'm just trying to help...,episode5
LEIA,We don't need any of your help.,episode5
LANDO,H-a-a-a...,episode5
LEIA,What?,episode5
THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.,episode5
LANDO,"There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East  Platform...",episode5
LEIA,Chewie.,episode5
THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee.",episode5
BOBA FETT,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.,episode5
THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?,episode5
THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!",episode5
THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!",episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!",episode5
VADER,"You have learned much, young one.",episode5
LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.,episode5
VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true.",episode5
LUKE,No!,episode5
VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.,episode5
VADER,Impressive...most impressive.,episode5
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.,episode5
VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.,episode5
LANDO,The security codes has been changed!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system.",episode5
LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.,episode5
LANDO,This way.,episode5
THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.,episode5
THREEPIO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.",episode5
THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!,episode5
THREEPIO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!",episode5
LANDO,Leia! Go!,episode5
THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better.",episode5
VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.,episode5
VADER,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.",episode5
LUKE,I'll never join you!,episode5
VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.,episode5
LUKE,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.,episode5
VADER,No. I am your father.,episode5
LUKE,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!,episode5
VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.,episode5
LUKE,No! No! No!,episode5
VADER,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.",episode5
LUKE,"Ben...Ben, please!",episode5
LUKE,Ben. Leia!,episode5
LUKE,Hear me! Leia!,episode5
LEIA,Luke...We've got to go back.,episode5
LANDO,What?,episode5
LEIA,I know where Luke is.,episode5
LANDO,But what about those fighter?,episode5
LEIA,"Chewie, just do it.",episode5
LANDO,But what about Vader?,episode5
LANDO,"All right, all right, all right.",episode5
VADER,Bring my shuttle.,episode5
LANDO,"Look, someone's up there.",episode5
LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.  Lando, open the top hatch.",episode5
LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie.",episode5
LEIA,Lando?,episode5
LANDO,"Okay, let's go.",episode5
LUKE,"Oh, Leia.",episode5
LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Let's go.",episode5
LEIA,I'll be back.,episode5
LEIA,Star Destroyer.,episode5
LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.",episode5
LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.,episode5
LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.,episode5
LANDO,Punch it!,episode5
LANDO,They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not  my fault!,episode5
PIETT,"They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.",episode5
VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?,episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.,episode5
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode5
THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?,episode5
THREEPIO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?,episode5
THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!",episode5
VADER,Luke.,episode5
LUKE,Father.,episode5
VADER,"Son, come with me.",episode5
LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?",episode5
LANDO,Chewie!,episode5
LUKE,It's Vader.,episode5
VADER,Luke...it is your destiny.,episode5
LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?",episode5
PIETT,Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.,episode5
THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!  You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!",episode5
THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!",episode5
LANDO,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff.",episode5
LUKE,"Good luck, Lando",episode5
LANDO,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty  hunter, we'll contact you.",episode5
LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tatooine.,episode5
LANDO,"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.",episode5
LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.",episode5

LUKE,Ow!,episode5
SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield.",episode6
DEATH STAR CONTROLLER,The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.,episode6
SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,We're starting our approach.,episode6
OFFICER,Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.,episode6
OPERATOR,"Yes, sir.",episode6
JERJERROD,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.  We're honored by your presence.",episode6
VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.",episode6
JERJERROD,"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.",episode6
VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.,episode6
JERJERROD,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.",episode6
VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.,episode6
JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.,episode6
VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.,episode6
JERJERROD,The Emperor's coming here?,episode6
VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.",episode6
JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.,episode6
VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.",episode6
THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.,episode6
STRANGE VOICE,Tee chuta hhat yudd!,episode6

THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.",episode6
BIB,Die Wanna Wanga!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.",episode6
THREEPIO,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?",episode6
BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.,episode6
THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.,episode6
THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.,episode6
BIB,Nudd Chaa.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.",episode6
THREEPIO,Good morning.,episode6
JABBA,Bo Shuda!,episode6
THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message.",episode6
LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.",episode6
THREEPIO,What did he say?,episode6
LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.,episode6
THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.",episode6
JABBA,There will be no bargain.,episode6
THREEPIO,We're doomed.,episode6
JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.",episode6
THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!,episode6
NINEDENINE,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?",episode6
THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy...",episode6
NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes.",episode6
NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?,episode6
THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...",episode6
NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.,episode6
THREEPIO,Disintegrated?,episode6
NINEDENINE,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!",episode6
NINEDENINE,"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.",episode6
JABBA,Da Eitha!,episode6
OOLA,Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...,episode6
JABBA,Boscka!,episode6
BOUSHH,I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!",episode6
JABBA,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!",episode6
THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.,episode6
BOUSHH,I want fifty thousand. No less.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.",episode6
THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.,episode6
JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.,episode6
THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.,episode6
BOUSHH,Zeebuss.,episode6
THREEPIO,He agrees!,episode6
BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.,episode6
BOUSHH,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.,episode6
HAN,I can't see.,episode6
BOUSHH,You eyesight will return in time.,episode6
HAN,Where am I?,episode6
BOUSHH,Jabba's palace.,episode6
HAN,Who are you?,episode6
LEIA,Someone who loves you.,episode6
HAN,Leia!,episode6
LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.,episode6
HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.,episode6
HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.",episode6
JABBA,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.",episode6
HAN,Look...,episode6
JABBA,Take him away!,episode6
HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!,episode6
JABBA,Bring her to me.,episode6
LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...,episode6
JABBA,I'm sure.,episode6
LEIA,Ugh!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.",episode6
HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?",episode6
HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!,episode6
HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?",episode6
HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.",episode6
HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.",episode6
HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.",episode6
LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.,episode6
LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!,episode6
LUKE,You serve your master well.,episode6
LUKE,And you will be rewarded.,episode6
THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.,episode6
BIB,Master.,episode6
BIB,"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.",episode6
JABBA,I told you not to admit him.,episode6
LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.,episode6
BIB,He must be allowed to speak.,episode6
JABBA,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.,episode6
LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.,episode6
JABBA,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.",episode6
LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on...",episode6
JABBA,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.",episode6
JABBA,Bascka!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!",episode6
JABBA,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.,episode6
LUKE,Han!,episode6
HAN,Luke!,episode6
LUKE,Are you all right?,episode6
HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?",episode6
LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.,episode6
HAN,How are we doing?,episode6
LUKE,The same as always.,episode6
HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",episode6
LEIA,I'm here.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.",episode6
HAN,"Good, I hate long waits.",episode6
THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",episode6
HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.,episode6
THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",episode6
HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",episode6
LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.",episode6
HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.",episode6
LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.",episode6
HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",episode6
LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.,episode6
HAN,Oh... great!,episode6
JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?",episode6
THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!",episode6
THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",episode6
HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?",episode6
LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.,episode6
JABBA,Move him into position.,episode6
JABBA,Put him in.,episode6
LUKE,"Easy, Chewie.",episode6
LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!,episode6
HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",episode6
HAN,"I'm okay, pal.",episode6
LANDO,Han! Chewie?,episode6
HAN,Lando!,episode6
HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?,episode6
HAN,"Lando, grab it!",episode6
LANDO,Lower it!,episode6
HAN,I'm trying!,episode6
HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.",episode6
HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!,episode6
HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!,episode6
LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!,episode6
HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.",episode6
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.",episode6
LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!",episode6
HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.,episode6
LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!,episode6
HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",episode6
LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!",episode6
LUKE,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!,episode6
LUKE,Point it at the deck!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.",episode6
LUKE,Come on!,episode6
LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.,episode6
LANDO,We're on our way.,episode6
HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!,episode6
LEIA,That's all any of us can see.,episode6
HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.,episode6
HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.",episode6
LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.,episode6
HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!",episode6
LUKE,I'll see you back at the fleet.,episode6
HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?,episode6
LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,episode6
HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.",episode6
LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.",episode6
LEIA,He means \,episode6
LANDO,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.",episode6
LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.,episode6
LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.,episode6
LUKE,I will.,episode6
HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.",episode6
LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Rise, my friend.",episode6
VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,episode6
EMPEROR,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.",episode6
VADER,"Yes, my Master.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.",episode6
VADER,As you wish.,episode6
EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,episode6
YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?,episode6
LUKE,No... of course not.,episode6
YODA,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?",episode6
YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.",episode6
LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die.",episode6
YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.,episode6
LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.,episode6
YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,episode6
LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?,episode6
YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",episode6
LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,episode6
YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,episode6
LUKE,"Yoda, I must know.",episode6
YODA,Your father he is.,episode6
YODA,"Told you, did he?",episode6
LUKE,Yes.,episode6
YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..",episode6
LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,episode6
YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.,episode6
LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry.",episode6
YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.",episode6
YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.",episode6
LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.",episode6
BEN,Yoda will always be with you.,episode6
LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?,episode6
LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,episode6
BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",episode6
LUKE,A certain point of view!,episode6
BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.",episode6
BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.",episode6
BEN,Anakin was a good friend.,episode6
BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.",episode6
LUKE,There's still good in him.,episode6
BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,episode6
LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben.",episode6
BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.,episode6
LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.,episode6
BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.",episode6
LUKE,But I had to help my friends.,episode6
BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.",episode6
LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.,episode6
BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!",episode6
LUKE,I can't kill my own father.,episode6
BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,episode6
LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.,episode6
BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,episode6
LUKE,But I have no sister.,episode6
BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",episode6
LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.,episode6
BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.",episode6
BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.",episode6
BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.",episode6
LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.",episode6
BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!",episode6
HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?",episode6
LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.",episode6
HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.",episode6
LANDO,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.,episode6
HAN,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?",episode6
MON MOTHMA,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.,episode6
MON MOTHMA,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.",episode6
MON MOTHMA,"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.",episode6
ACKBAR,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.",episode6
ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack,episode6
HAN,Good luck.,episode6
HAN,You're gonna need it.,episode6
ACKBAR,General Madine.,episode6
GENERAL MADINE,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.",episode6
THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.,episode6
LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.,episode6
GENERAL MADINE,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?",episode6
HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.",episode6
HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.",episode6
HAN,That's one.,episode6
LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in.",episode6
VOICE,"I'm with you, too!",episode6
LEIA,What is it?,episode6
LUKE,Ask me again sometime.,episode6
HAN,Luke.,episode6
LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie.",episode6
THREEPIO,\,episode6
HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.,episode6
LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?",episode6
HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,episode6
LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate.",episode6
LANDO,Good luck.,episode6
HAN,"You, too.",episode6
HAN,You got her warmed?,episode6
LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up.",episode6
HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.",episode6
LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?",episode6
HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.",episode6
LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move.",episode6
HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?",episode6
LUKE,All set.,episode6
THREEPIO,Here we go again.,episode6
HAN,"All right, hang on.",episode6
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?",episode6
EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,episode6
VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,episode6
EMPEROR,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.",episode6
VADER,"Yes, my Master.",episode6
HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.",episode6
CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.,episode6
HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.,episode6
CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.",episode6
HAN,Transmission commencing.,episode6
LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.,episode6
HAN,It'll work. It'll work.,episode6
LUKE,Vader's on that ship.,episode6
HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.",episode6
HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.,episode6
LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.,episode6
HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.",episode6
VADER,Where is that shuttle going?,episode6
PIETT,"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?",episode6
PILOT VOICE,Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.,episode6
VADER,Do they have a code clearance?,episode6
PIETT,"It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.",episode6
PIETT,Shall I hold them?,episode6
VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,episode6
PIETT,"As you wish, my lord.  Carry on.",episode6
HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie.",episode6
CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course.",episode6
HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",episode6
LEIA,Shall we try and go around?,episode6
HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.,episode6
HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.,episode6
LUKE,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there.",episode6
HAN,Hey... it's me.,episode6
SCOUT #1,Go for help! Go!,episode6
LUKE,Great. Come on.,episode6
LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!,episode6
LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!",episode6
LUKE,Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!,episode6
HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!",episode6
LUKE,Move closer!,episode6
LUKE,Get alongside that one!,episode6
LUKE,Get him!,episode6
LUKE,Keep on that one! I'll take these two!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!",episode6
HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?,episode6
LUKE,What? She didn't come back?,episode6
HAN,I thought she was with you.,episode6
LUKE,We got separated.,episode6
LUKE,"Hey, we better go look for her.",episode6
HAN,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.,episode6
LUKE,"Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.",episode6
THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!,episode6
LEIA,Cut it out!,episode6
LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.,episode6
LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is.",episode6
LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.",episode6
LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.,episode6
LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?,episode6
LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?,episode6
LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?",episode6
LEIA,What is it?,episode6
SCOUT #l,"Freeze!  Come on, get up!",episode6
SCOUT #1,Go get your ride and take her back to base.,episode6
SCOUT #2,"Yes, sir.",episode6
LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here.",episode6
GUARD,Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.,episode6
VADER,"The Emperor will see me, now!",episode6
GUARD,"The Emperor will see you, now.",episode6
EMPEROR,I told you to remain on the command ship.,episode6
VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.,episode6
EMPEROR,"Yes, I know.",episode6
VADER,My son is with them.,episode6
EMPEROR,Are you sure?,episode6
VADER,"I have felt him, my Master.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.",episode6
VADER,"They are clear, my Master.",episode6
EMPEROR,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.,episode6
VADER,He will come to me?,episode6
EMPEROR,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.,episode6
VADER,As you wish.,episode6
HAN,Luke! Luke!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, Master Luke.",episode6
LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.,episode6
THREEPIO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.,episode6
HAN,I hope she's alright.,episode6
HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!",episode6
HAN,"Hey, I don't get it.",episode6
HAN,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.",episode6
LUKE,"Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!",episode6
HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.",episode6
LUKE,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?",episode6
HAN,"Yeah, sure.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!",episode6
HAN,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.,episode6
HAN,Hey!,episode6
LUKE,"Han, don't. It'll be all right.",episode6
LUKE,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!",episode6
LUKE,Do you understand anything they're saying?,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.",episode6
HAN,What are you telling them?,episode6
THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",episode6
HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?",episode6
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.",episode6
HAN,Proper?!,episode6
THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.,episode6
HAN,"Why, you--",episode6
HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.,episode6
HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.,episode6
HAN,What did he say?,episode6
THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.",episode6
HAN and LUKE,Leia!,episode6
LEIA,Oh!,episode6
THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.,episode6
LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.",episode6
HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.",episode6
LUKE,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.",episode6
THREEPIO,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --",episode6
LUKE,Just tell them.,episode6
THREEPIO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...",episode6
THREEPIO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.",episode6
LUKE,"Thanks, Threepio.",episode6
THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.",episode6
HAN,What's going on?,episode6
LEIA,I don't know.,episode6
THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.,episode6
HAN,Just what I always wanted.,episode6
HAN,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay.",episode6
THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.,episode6
HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.",episode6
HAN,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.",episode6
LUKE,"Luke, what's wrong?",episode6
LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?,episode6
LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.,episode6
LUKE,What do you remember?,episode6
LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings.",episode6
LUKE,Tell me.,episode6
LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?",episode6
LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.,episode6
LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?",episode6
LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon.",episode6
LEIA,How do you know?,episode6
LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him.",episode6
LEIA,Why?,episode6
LUKE,He's my father.,episode6
LEIA,Your father?,episode6
LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",episode6
LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.",episode6
LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.",episode6
LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.,episode6
LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.,episode6
LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.,episode6
LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.",episode6
LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong.",episode6
LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?",episode6
LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,episode6
HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?",episode6
LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,episode6
HAN,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?",episode6
LEIA,I...I can't tell you.,episode6
HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?,episode6
LEIA,I...,episode6
HAN,Ahhh...,episode6
HAN,I'm sorry.,episode6
LEIA,Hold me.,episode6
COMMANDER,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.",episode6
COMMANDER,He was armed only with this.,episode6
VADER,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.",episode6
COMMANDER,"Yes, my Lord.",episode6
VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.,episode6
LUKE,"I know, father.",episode6
VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth.",episode6
LUKE,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",episode6
VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,episode6
LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.,episode6
VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.,episode6
VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.",episode6
LUKE,Come with me.,episode6
VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.,episode6
VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,episode6
LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.,episode6
VADER,If that is your destiny.,episode6
LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",episode6
VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",episode6
LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.,episode6
LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.,episode6
HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.",episode6
LEIA,What's he saying?,episode6
THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,episode6
LANDO,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.",episode6
ACKBAR,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.,episode6
LANDO,"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.",episode6
ACKBAR,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.",episode6
LANDO,All right. Stand by.,episode6
HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea.",episode6
HAN,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.,episode6
LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.",episode6
HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!",episode6
LEIA,Quiet.,episode6
THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.,episode6
LEIA,"Oh, no.",episode6
HAN,There goes our surprise attack.,episode6
SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!,episode6
HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.,episode6
THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.,episode6
EMPEROR,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.",episode6
EMPEROR,You no longer need those.,episode6
EMPEROR,"Guards, leave us.",episode6
EMPEROR,I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.,episode6
LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.,episode6
EMPEROR,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.",episode6
VADER,His lightsaber.,episode6
EMPEROR,"Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.",episode6
LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.,episode6
EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.,episode6
EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.,episode6
LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,episode6
EMPEROR,Your faith in your friends is yours.,episode6
VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son.",episode6
EMPEROR,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...,episode6
EMPEROR,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.,episode6
EMPEROR,Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.,episode6
HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.",episode6
LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.,episode6
HAN,"Charges!  Come on, come on!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.",episode6
COMMANDER,Freeze! You Rebel scum.,episode6
LANDO,All wings report in.,episode6
WEDGE,Red Leader standing by.,episode6
GRAY LEADER,Gray Leader standing by.,episode6
GREEN LEADER,Green Leader standing by.,episode6
WEDGE,Lock S-foils in attack positions.,episode6
ACKBAR,May the Force be with us.,episode6
LANDO,"We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.",episode6
LANDO,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.,episode6
RED LEADER,I get no reading. Are you sure?,episode6
LANDO,Pull up! All craft pull up!,episode6
ACKBAR,"Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.",episode6
CONTROLLER,"Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.",episode6
ACKBAR,It's a trap!,episode6
LANDO,Fighters coming in.,episode6
REBEL PILOT,There's too many of them!,episode6
LANDO,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.,episode6
WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Come, boy. See for yourself.",episode6
EMPEROR,"From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.",episode6
EMPEROR,"You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.",episode6
LUKE,No!,episode6
EMPEROR,"It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!",episode6
STORMTROOPER,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!",episode6
THREEPIO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?",episode6
BUNKER COMMANDER,Bring those two down here!,episode6
STORMTROOPER,Let's go!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?",episode6
STORMTROOPER,Freeze! Don't move!,episode6
THREEPIO,We surrender.,episode6
THREEPIO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.",episode6
LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!,episode6
HAN,Here's the terminal.,episode6
LEIA,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.",episode6
THREEPIO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!",episode6
LANDO,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!",episode6
WEDGE,"Red Three, Red Two, pull in!",episode6
RED TWO,Got it!,episode6
RED THREE,"Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!",episode6
WEDGE,Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.,episode6
NAVIGATOR,Pressure's steady.,episode6
LANDO,Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.,episode6
COMMANDER,"We're in attack position now, sir.",episode6
PIETT,Hold here.,episode6
COMMANDER,We're not going to attack?,episode6
PIETT,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.,episode6
EMPEROR,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will, Commander.",episode6
JERJERROD,Fire!,episode6
LANDO,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader.",episode6
ACKBAR,We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.,episode6
LANDO,"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.",episode6
ACKBAR,"We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.",episode6
LANDO,Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.,episode6
THREEPIO,We're coming!,episode6
HAN,Come on! Come on!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!",episode6
THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?",episode6
HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.",episode6
LEIA,I'll cover you.,episode6
LANDO,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.,episode6
ACKBAR,"At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.",episode6
LANDO,We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.,episode6
REBEL PILOT,She's gonna blow!,episode6
Y-WING PILOT,I'm hit!,episode6
EMPEROR,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.",episode6
WALKER PILOT #1,Look!,episode6
PILOT #2,Get him off of there!,episode6
HAN,I think I got it. I got it!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?",episode6
HAN,Let's see.,episode6
LEIA,It's not bad.,episode6
STORMTROOPER,Freeze!,episode6
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear.",episode6
STORMTROOPER,Don't move!,episode6
HAN,I love you.,episode6
LEIA,I know.,episode6
STORMTROOPER,Hands up! Stand up!,episode6
HAN,Stay back.,episode6
HAN,"Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.",episode6
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.,episode6
LUKE,"I will not fight you, father.",episode6
VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.,episode6
LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.",episode6
VADER,There is no conflict.,episode6
LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.",episode6
VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.",episode6
EMPEROR,Good.  Good.,episode6
LANDO,Watch out. Squad at .06.,episode6
REBEL PILOT,"I'm on it, Gold Leader.",episode6
WEDGE,"Good shot, Red Two.",episode6
LANDO,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.",episode6
HAN/PILOT,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.",episode6
CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER,Send three squads to help. Open the back door.,episode6
SECOND COMMANDER,"Yes, sir.",episode6
HAN,Throw me another charge.,episode6
VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke.",episode6
LUKE,I will not fight you.,episode6
VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...",episode6
VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.",episode6
LUKE,Never-r-r!,episode6
EMPEROR,"Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!",episode6
LUKE,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.",episode6
EMPEROR,So be it...Jedi.,episode6
HAN,Move! Move!,episode6
ACKBAR,The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.,episode6
LANDO,"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!",episode6
EMPEROR,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.",episode6
EMPEROR,Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.,episode6
LUKE,"Father, please. Help me.",episode6
EMPEROR,"Now, young Skywalker...you will die.",episode6
WEDGE,I'm going in.,episode6
LANDO,Here goes nothing.,episode6
LANDO,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.,episode6
WEDGE,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.,episode6
LANDO,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.,episode6
PILOT,"Copy, Gold Leader.",episode6
LANDO,That was too close.,episode6
ACKBAR,We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.,episode6
CONTROLLER,"Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.",episode6
PIETT,Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.,episode6
PIETT,Intensify forward firepower!,episode6
COMMANDER,It's too late!,episode6
VADER,"Luke, help me take this mask off.",episode6
LURE,But you'll die.,episode6
VADER,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.,episode6
ANAKIN,"Now...go, my son. Leave me.",episode6
LUKE,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.,episode6
ANAKIN,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.",episode6
LUKE,Father... I won't leave you.,episode6
WEDGE,There it is!,episode6
LANDO,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.",episode6
WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.",episode6
ACKBAR,Move the fleet away from the Death Star.,episode6
LANDO,"Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it.",episode6
WEDGE,You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.,episode6
LANDO,I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.,episode6
HAN,Lando...,episode6
THREEPIO,They did it!,episode6
